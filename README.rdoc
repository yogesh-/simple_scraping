This is simple few lines of code to scrape a website and get the data as it is desired.

Inspiration from :- https://www.youtube.com/user/CodingEntrepreneurs // Justin Mitchel.

Things to add:-
  1. export data to csv
  2. currently only single page is being scraped but do if for the next 10 pages for same search
  
  
Anything to add more guys ?
